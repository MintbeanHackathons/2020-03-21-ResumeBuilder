# Today's Objective: Hack the Résumé

Tip: Read [General Information.md]("./General Information.md") for more info on how to get started and submit.

In our last Hackathon, we built a project where we generated a resume from a JSON object. 

Today, we will do the opposite -- we will create a simple resume builder form that saves resume information inside a [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) object.

## Requirements

JSON Resume [supports many fields](https://jsonresume.org/schema/). Your goal is to create a builder that supports all of these fields. The builder must then output data to JSON Resume.

Required:
* Your builder must have an input form.
* Your builder must supports all JSON Resume fields.
* For array fields, your builder must support unlimited numbers of entries.

### Builder Input Requirements

You may use any GUI you wish:
* Plain HTML
* React
* Vue
* Angular
* Electron
* CLI (yes, you can make this a terminal-only project)

### Builder Output Requirements

* Your output must be in JSON Resume format.
* You may either (a) display the output immediately, OR (b) save it to a file.

## Restrictions

Your project must use JavaScript.

There are no other restrictions.

#### Tips for success:

1. The project is intentionally simple so you can focus on code quality.
1. The requirements are intentionally minimalistic so you can get as creative as you'd like.
1. Code review is an opportunity for everyone to really shine.
