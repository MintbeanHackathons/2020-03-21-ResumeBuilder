# The Idea
Based on the schema, there are several categories, basic, edication, volunteer, work, etc. I would like to create a form that would transition between the categories, by clicking a next and a back button. 

## Challenge 
Time. I spent too much time on setting up the base line, I also spent quite some time to ensure the button functions. Near the end I resort to setting up style intead.
